<h3>1. Shutter Island</h3>
<p> 
    The implausible escape of a brilliant murderess brings U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) <br />
    and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to Ashecliffe Hospital, a fortress-like insane asylum located on a <br />
    remote, windswept island. The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of <br />
    terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls. As the investigation deepens, Teddy realizes he will <br />
    have to confront his own dark fears if he hopes to make it off the island alive.
</p>

<h3>2. Fight Club</h3>
<p> A depressed man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia meets a strange soap salesman named Tyler Durden <br />
    (Brad Pitt) and soon finds himself living in his squalid house after his perfect apartment is destroyed. <br />
    The two bored men form an underground club with strict rules and fight other men who are fed up with their <br />
    mundane lives. Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group <br />
    crasher, attracts Tyler's attention.
</p>

<h3>3. Inception</h3>
<p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their <br />
    secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate <br />
    espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is <br />
    offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be <br />
    the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.
